# Sample Status

This file tracks the current state of the local sample corpus as it relates to
emulator behavior.

## `arm64_hello`

- Path: [fixtures/macos/bin/arm64_hello](D:/dev/quiling/qiling/fixtures/macos/bin/arm64_hello)
- Role: smoke-test fixture
- Expected status: should execute successfully
- Current note: used as the primary quick validation sample for `cargo build --bin machina` and basic runtime checks

## `2d0dda75bfc90e7ffda72640eb32c7ff9f51c90c30f4a6d1e05df93e58848f36.macho`

- Path: [fixtures/macos/bin/2d0dda75bfc90e7ffda72640eb32c7ff9f51c90c30f4a6d1e05df93e58848f36.macho](D:/dev/quiling/qiling/fixtures/macos/bin/2d0dda75bfc90e7ffda72640eb32c7ff9f51c90c30f4a6d1e05df93e58848f36.macho)
- Family: AMOS stealer
- Architecture: arm64
- Current observed status:
  - probes browser and wallet paths
  - probes browser profile roots such as Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Firefox
  - attempts to open wallet/private data such as Binance, Electrum, Coinomi, and Exodus paths
  - reads synthetic fallback content from guest filesystem policy
  - CI regression guard verifies these milestones from JSONL trace output on Ubuntu
- Important implication:
  - emulator is already past bootstrap/runtime-only execution and into real stealer logic
  - next compatibility work should focus on richer profile traversal and artifact semantics rather than simple `ENOENT` fixes

- Path: [fixtures/macos/bin/0393e898f4425195d780346634e619b80f283a8223b9724db56dee87afbba486.macho](D:/dev/quiling/qiling/fixtures/macos/bin/0393e898f4425195d780346634e619b80f283a8223b9724db56dee87afbba486.macho)
- Current observed status:
  - retained as a large arm64 analysis target
- Important implication:
  - this sample is both an execution target and a reverse-engineering reference set

## `rustdoor/76f96a35b6f638eed779dc127f29a5b537ffc3bb7accc2c9bfab5a2120ea6bc9.macho`

- Family: RustDoor
- Architecture: arm64
- Current observed status:
  - parses, maps, and loads Foundation/AppKit/CoreFoundation/Security/libobjc dependencies
  - reaches real runtime/import activity instead of stopping at initial unresolved bindings
  - exercises TLV bootstrap, signal/bootstrap imports, heap growth, `memcmp`, `memmove`, `memcpy`, `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free`
  - now synthetically handles arm64 LSE `ldadd`, `ldapr`, and `cas` runtime atomics that previously consumed the execution budget
  - resolves bootstrap environment lookups such as `getenv("HOME")` from the synthetic guest envp
  - currently ends with `timeout_budget_exhausted` rather than an unmapped branch/fetch crash
  - current hot path has moved beyond the first Rust runtime startup guard and into later runtime panic/assert paths around `brk #0x1`
- Important implication:
  - the main blocker has moved from import coverage and missing arm64 atomic semantics into later runtime/control-flow behavior
  - next compatibility work for this family should focus on reducing artificial libc/runtime churn and improving higher-level Apple runtime progress

## Corpus hygiene

- New samples should be added with a short status note here.
